<h1>Hello (world) and welcome to my home on the internet, a work in progress.</h1>

<p>
I was born, raised, and educated, on the border of the Chicago suburbs and the corn fields of fly over country.  My time at UIUC and SpaceX established my first principles approach, and my curiosity for entrepreneurship and sustainability, and my desire for the western outdoors, lead me to the Bay Area and the stationary storage team at Tesla.  My passion for cycling has grown since.

See <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/4372022">Strava</a> and

I use <a href="https://medium.com/@jasonroesslein">Medium</a> to write year-in-reviews for close friends and family, but haven't publically blogged since college, and I might get on <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonroesslein">Twitter</a> at some point.
